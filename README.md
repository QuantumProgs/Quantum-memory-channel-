# Quantum-memory-channel-
Simulation of open quantum system dynamics for quantum channels with memory

Hello!

Here I represent dynamic simulation of tensor network that describes quantum channels with memory.
Script ""


From the picture:
\Phi[\varrho(t)] = U(H)\varrho_{S+E}(0)U(H)^{+}
U(H) - evolution operator
q_{k_{i}} - enter states
\phi_{k_{i}} - states after measure
S - state system at the beginning
E - stete environment at th beginning
